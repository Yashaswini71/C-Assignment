===================================== TYPEDEF =========================================

1) In the following code, the P2 is Integer Pointer or Integer?
typedef int *ptr;
ptr p1, p2;
->p2 is integer pointer

2)  In the following code what is 'P'?
typedef char *charp;
const charp P;
->p is constant character pointer

3) What is x in the following program?
#include<stdio.h>
int main()
{
    typedef char (*(*arrfptr[3])())[10];
    arrfptr x;
    return 0;
}
-> x is character pointer to (array of function pointer of size 3)of size 10

4) What is apfArithmatics in the below statement?
typedef int (*apfArithmatics[3])(int,int); 
->ApfArithmatics is integer (array of function pointers with two integer parameters) of size 3

5) What is pf in the below statement?
typedef int (*pf)(int);
->pf is function pointer with one integer parameter and integer return type

6) What do the following declarations mean?
typedef char *pc;
typedef pc fpc();
typedef fpc *pfpc;
typedef pfpc fpfpc();
typedef fpfpc *pfpfpc;
pfpfpc a[N];

7) Write few programs using typedef on structures and enums.
